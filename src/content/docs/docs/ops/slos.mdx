title: Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
description: SLOs and performance targets for DuraGraph
---

This document outlines our defined SLOs, alerting thresholds, and how we validate system performance under load.

---

## SLO Definitions

1. **Run Start Latency (p95)**
   - **Target**: ≤ 2s to enqueue a workflow run after API `POST /runs`.
   - **Alert**: p95 latency &gt; 5s sustained for 5 minutes.

2. **Run Success Rate**
   - **Target**: ≥ 99% of runs succeed end-to-end.
   - **Alert**: success rate &lt; 95% for 10 minutes.

3. **Stream Gaps (SSE)**
   - **Target**: zero dropped or out-of-order events.
   - **Alert**: &gt;10 SSE gaps/minute per instance.

---

## Alerts & Thresholds

- Run start latency: Alert `critical` &gt;5s, `warning` &gt;3s.
- Run success rate: Alert `critical` &lt;95%, `warning` &lt;98%.
- Stream gap rate: Alert `critical` &gt;50/min, `warning` &gt;10/min.

---

## Load Testing

We use load tests (e.g. Locust, k6) to validate SLOs at scale:

- Ramp up to 1000 concurrent runs.
- Measure latency distribution, stream continuity, and worker throughput.
- Compare against defined targets.

---

## Backpressure Behavior

When the system is overloaded:

- **API** returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header.
- Clients must back off and retry after suggested interval.
- This ensures event queues and API servers are not overwhelmed.

---

## Notes

- SLO compliance is reviewed quarterly.
- Dashboards and alerting rules in Prometheus/Grafana enforce these thresholds.
- SLO outcomes feed into error budgets for operational planning.
