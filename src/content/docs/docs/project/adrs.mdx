title: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
description: Record of significant technical decisions in DuraGraph
---

This file indexes all ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for the DuraGraph project.
ADRs record significant technical and architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## ADR Index

:::note[Coming Soon]
Individual ADR documents are being migrated to this documentation site.
:::

- **ADR-0001: Use Event Sourcing for Run State** — All state changes are persisted as immutable events
- **ADR-0002: Use CQRS Pattern** — Separation of write (commands) and read (queries)
- **ADR-0003: Use Outbox Pattern for Reliable Events** — Transactional outbox for at-least-once delivery

---

## Process

1. When making an architecture decision, add a new ADR in `docs/adr/`.
2. Use the template format with context, decision, and consequences.
3. Update this index to link the new ADR.
