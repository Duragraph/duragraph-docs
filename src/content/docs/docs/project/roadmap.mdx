## Principles

- **One thing well**: Each quarter has a single primary focus
- **Sustainable pace**: Buffer for community support, documentation, and unexpected work
- **Demonstrable progress**: Each milestone represents tangible, testable outcomes
- **Open development**: Progress tracked publicly via GitHub issues and releases

---

## Out of Scope

- Running untrusted user code inline in the API servers
- SLA-backed hosted services (focus is open source, self-host first)
- Proprietary model integrations (focus is on open schema, not vendor lock-in)
