This document describes how to contribute to the DuraGraph project.

---

## Local Development

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Duragraph/duragraph.git
   cd duragraph
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - **Go**: `go mod tidy`
   - **Task**: Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev) runner

3. Run services locally:
   ```bash
   task up
   ```

---

## Task Commands

Common `task` commands are provided:

- `task build:server` – build Go server binary
- `task test` – run all tests
- `task lint:go` – run linting
- `task up` – start local environment via Docker Compose
- `task down` – stop local environment
- `task health` – check health of all services

---

## Commit Style

We use **Conventional Commits**:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `chore:` for maintenance
- `test:` for adding tests

Example:

```
feat(api): add SSE streaming endpoint
```

---

## Code Style

- **Go**: enforced via `gofmt`, `goimports`, and `golangci-lint` in CI.
- **Python**: linted with `ruff`, type-checked with `mypy`, formatted with `black`.
- **TypeScript**: linted with `eslint`, formatted with `prettier`.

Consistency is enforced with pre-commit hooks.

---

## Test Policy

- All new features must include corresponding unit tests.
- Conformance tests must pass before merging.
- Integration tests validate API ↔ Database ↔ Event streaming.

Run full Go tests:

```bash
task test
```

Run unit tests only:

```bash
task test:unit
```

---

## Conformance Tests

To run conformance tests across adapters:

```bash
make conformance
```

These verify that both Go and Python workers conform to the activity contract.
