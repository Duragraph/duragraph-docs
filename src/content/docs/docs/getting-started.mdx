title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with DuraGraph in 5 minutes
---

Get DuraGraph running locally and execute your first workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (optional, for convenience commands)

## 1. Start DuraGraph

Clone and start all services:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duragraph/duragraph.git
cd duragraph
task up
```

This starts:

- **API Server** (port 8081) — REST API and SSE streaming
- **PostgreSQL** — Event store and projections
- **NATS JetStream** — Event streaming
- **Dashboard** (port 3000) — Workflow monitoring UI

Verify services are running:

```bash
task health
```

## 2. Create Your First Workflow

Create an assistant:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/assistants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "hello-assistant", "graph_schema": {}}'
```

Create a thread:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/threads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

Create a run (replace `<thread_id>` and `<assistant_id>` with values from above):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "thread_id": "<thread_id>",
    "assistant_id": "<assistant_id>",
    "input": {"message": "Hello!"}
  }'
```

## 3. Monitor Your Workflow

Open the Dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to:

- View workflow execution logs
- Monitor run status in real-time
- Debug failed runs
- Explore workflow graphs

## 4. Stream Events

Subscribe to real-time updates for a run:

```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/stream?run_id=<run_id>"
```

## Next Steps

- **[Self-Hosted Installation](/docs/user-guide/installation/self-hosted)** — Production deployment
- **[First Workflow Tutorial](/docs/user-guide/tutorials/first-workflow)** — Build a complete workflow
- **[LangGraph Migration](/docs/user-guide/tutorials/langgraph-migration)** — Migrate from LangGraph Cloud
- **[Architecture Overview](/docs/architecture/overview)** — Understand the system design

## Troubleshooting

**Services won't start?**

```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs api
```

**Port already in use?**

```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8081

# Stop all services and restart
task down && task up
```
