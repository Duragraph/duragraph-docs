This page documents the REST and SSE API endpoints exposed by the system.

The API specification is defined in [`schemas/openapi/duragraph.yaml`](../schemas/openapi/duragraph.yaml).
It is rendered automatically below using the MkDocs OpenAPI plugin:

```yaml
::: openapi schemas/openapi/duragraph.yaml
```

## Common Examples

### 1. Create Assistant

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/assistants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Assistant",
    "description": "Helps with workflow orchestration"
  }'
```

---

### 2. Create Thread

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/threads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "assistant_id": "asst_123",
    "title": "My first thread"
  }'
```

---

### 3. Create Message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "thread_id": "thread_123",
    "content": "Hello world!"
  }'
```

---

### 4. Create Run & Consume Stream

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "thread_id": "thread_123"
  }' \
  --output - | while read line; do
    echo "$line"
  done
```

This uses `-N` to disable buffering and consumes SSE events as they stream from `/stream`.

---

### 5. List Runs Filtered by Thread

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/runs?thread_id=thread_123"
```

## Notes

- All endpoints follow REST conventions.
- Streaming responses use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.
